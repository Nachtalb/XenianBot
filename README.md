## Contributions
### Bug report / Feature request
If you have found a bug or want a new feature, please file an issue on GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/Nachtalb/python_telegram_bot_template/issues)

### Code Contribution / Pull Requests
Please use a line length of 120 characters and [Google Style Python Docstrings](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).

### Development
Instead of the old `pip` with `requirements.txt`, I use the new and fancy [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile),
which works with [pipfile](https://docs.pipenv.org). You can get more information by following the links. If you read
the pipenv documentation you will also be able to understand by yourself why I use, it instead of me talking about it here.

With this info we now install our virtualenv with:
```bash
pip install pipenv      # Install pipenv
pipenv install --three  # Create virtualeenv from your python3 installation and install the packages from the Pipfile
pipenv shell            # Spawn shell for your pipenv virtualenv
```

After this is complete, you have to get an API Token from Telegram. You can easily get one via the
[@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

Now that you have your API Token, copy the `settings.example.py` to `settings.py` and paste in your API Token. Configure
the rest of the settings.py and you are ready to go. Start the bot
```bash
python run_bot.py
```

#### Command Concept
I am still working on how I want to make the commends to be used as easily as possible. At the moment this is how it
works:

In the folder `python_telegram_bot_template/commands/` you'll find a `__init__.py`, `base.py` and `builtins.py`.
The `base.py` contains the base command, which is used for every other command. It has the following attributes:
- `all_commands`: This is a variable containing all the commands which you create with this class as Parent. If you
override the `__init__` method you have to call super init otherwise, the command will not be added to this list. This
list is used for adding the commands as handlers for telegram and for creating the commands list.
- `commands`: This is a list of dictionaries in which you can define commands. This list contains the following keys:
    - `title` (optional): If no title given the name of the command function is taken (underscores replaced with space 
        and the first word is capitalized)A string for a title for the command. This does not have to be the same as the 
        `command_name`. Your `command_name` could be eg. `desc` so the command would be `/desc`, but the title would be 
        `Describe`. Like this, it is easier for the user to get the meaning of function from a command directly from the 
        command list.
    - `description` (optional): Default is an empty string. As the name says, this is the description. It is shown on 
        the command list. Describe what your command does in a few words.
    - `command_name`: Default is the name of the given command function. This is what the user has to run So for the 
        start command it would be `start`. If you do not define one yourself, the lowercase string of the name of your 
        class is taken.
    - `command` (mandatory): This is the function of the command. This has to be set.
    - `handler` (optional): Default is the CommandHandler. This is the handler your command uses. This could be 
        `MessageHandler`, `CommandHandler` or any other handler.
    - `options` (optional): By default the callback and command are set. If you add another argument you do not have to 
        define callback and command in the CommandHandler again and callback in the MessageHandler. 
        This is a dict of arguments given to the handler.
    - `hidden` (optional): Default is False. If True the command is hidden from the command list.
    - `args` (optional): If you have args, you can write them here. Eg. a command like this: `/add_human Nick 20 male` 
        your text would be like `NAME AGE GENDER`. 

After you create your class, you have to call it at least once. It doesn't matter where you call it from, but I like
to just call it directly after the code, as you can see in the builtins.py. And do not forget that the file with the
command must be loaded imported somewhere. I usually do this directly in the `__init__.py`.

A good example can be found in the `reverse_image_search.py`: 
https://github.com/Nachtalb/XenianBot/blob/b482cbf8a1eb2ebe3f9683c9144bd3e222a26716/xenian_bot/commands/reverse_image_search.py#L23-L56

#### Uploaders Concept
Like for the commands I tried to make it easier to use different kinds of file storage. You can find a configuration in
the settings.py and the "uploaders" itself in the `python_telegram_bot_template/uploaaders/` folder. The goal is that
you can only change the configuration in the settings.py and your bot works without any further adjustment. So you could
use the local file system for local development and then switch to ssh for production, or something like this.

You get the uploader by `from python_telegram_bot_template.uploaders import uploader`. If you use it you should always
start with `uploader.connect()` then upload / save whatever you want with `uploader.upload(...)` and finally close the
connection with `uploader.close()`. You should even use this if you are using the file system. It is to prevent errors
when you switch it someday in the future.

Now to the attributes and so on:
- `_mandatory_configuration`: It defines what must be in the configuration inside the settings.py.
E.g. for the file system this is
```python
{'path': str}
```
which means you have to define
```python
UPLOADER = {
    'uploader': 'xenian_bot.uploaders.file_system.FileSystemUploader',  # What uploader to use
    'configuration': {
        'path': '/some/path/to/your/uploads',
    }
}
```
If you are using the ssh uploader you have to define more:
```python
{'host': str, 'user': str, 'password': str, 'upload_dir': str}
```
```python
UPLOADER = {
    'uploader': 'xenian_bot.uploaders.ssh.SSHUploader',
    'configuration': {
        'host': '000.000.000.000',
        'user': 'chuck.norris',
        'password': 'i_am_immortal',
        'upload_dir': '/some/path/on/your/server/',
        'key_filename': '/home/chuck.norris/.ssh/id_rsa',  # This is not defined as mandatory because on most ssh
        # servers you don't only use the ssh key as authentication, but if you do define this configuration as well.
    }
}
```
As you can see in the dict's above it is always a name as key and a type as value. This is checked when you initialize
the uploader the first time.
- `configuration`: Filled in on the initialization from the uploader. It contains the configuration defined in the
settings.py


Now to the methods:
- `__init__`: As always this initializes the uploader. If you need to override it, don't forget to call super init
otherwise, the configuration is not checked and applied.
- `connect`: Connect to the server / service or whatever. This method doesn't need to be implemented. E.g. the file
system didn't need it.
- `close`: Close the connection to the server / service ... This method too doesn't have to be implemented.
- `uplaod`: In here you define the actual logic of the uploader. If you do not implement this method in your custom
uploader there will be an `NotImplementedError` raised, when used.

Thank you for using [@XenianBot](https://t.me/XenianBot).
