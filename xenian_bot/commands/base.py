class BaseCommand:
    """Base of any command class

    This is the base which should be used for any new command class. A command class is a class containing one or more
    commands. For this to work the created command class must be called afterwards at least once. Like this an entry is
    made in this classes :obj:`BaseCommand.all_commands` for the new command class. This has the advantage that you can
    store all the data for your commands together in one place.

    Your commands are also automatically added to the Telegram Updater, as well as listed in the output of the /commands
    command from the :class:`xenian_bot.commands.builtins.Builtins` commands (unless you have hidden on true for your
    command).

    Examples:
        >>> from telegram.ext import Filters
        >>> from xenian_bot.commands.base import BaseCommand
        >>>
        >>> class MyCommands(BaseCommand):
        >>>     def __init__(self):
        >>>         self.commands = [
        >>>             {
        >>>                 'title': 'Echo yourself',
        >>>                 'description': 'Return messages that you send me',
        >>>                 'command': self.echo,
        >>>                 'handler': MessageHandler,
        >>>                 'options': {'filters': Filters.text},
        >>>                 'group': 0
        >>>             }
        >>>         ]

        >>>     def echo(self, bot, update):
        >>>         update.message.reply_text(update.message.text)
